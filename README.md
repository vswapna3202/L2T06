## L2T06 : Data Visualisation Approach and Techniques

This task examines the graphs below and use some research and background knowledge to make conclusions based on observations.  All explanations for the analysis based on graphs and scatter plots are provided in data_viz.pdf.

### Gender Wage Gap
The bar graph  shows the gender wage gap in 26 countries based on data collected by the OECD. The gender wage gap is calculated by finding the difference between male and female median wages and dividing it by male median wages. It is represented as a percentage in this graph. The following analysis has been obtained from the graph  
    ● Three countries have the lowest gender wage gap.  
    ● Three countries have the highest gender wage gap.  
    ● Research on the country with the lowest gender wage gap and on why it succeeded in achieving a low gender wage gap in 2015.

### Isopranol Sale in US
The following line graph shows the sale of isopropanol from May 2019 to March 2020 in the United States of America. The sales are measured using US cents per weight (lb) of the product (US CTS/lb). The following has been analysed from the graph:  
    ● Analysis on what happened during March 2020 with regards to isopropanol sales.  
    ● Possible reasons for the observation  about isopropanol sales in March 2020.  

### CO2 emissions per person in tonnes vs GDP per capita
The bubble plot (a scatter plot with variable dot size) shows carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per person in tonnes vs the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (average per person). No unit is given for the GDP per capita; however, the US dollar is typically used when comparing different countries (Callen, n.d.). The analysis has been to:   
    ● Analyses the relationship between CO2 emissions per person and GDP per capita for each continent listed.  

### Boston Housing Dataset
Examines the scatterplot matrix is from the Boston Housing dataset. It examines
certain characteristics of a neighbourhood along with the median house value of
that neighbourhood.   
    ● Analyses if Boston have a lot of crime generally.  
    ● Analyses number of rooms do Boston dwellings have.  
    ● Figures if number of rooms per dwelling have an impact on housing prices.  
    ● Finds based on the plots if most of the houses in Boston are new.    
    ● Checks if modern neighbourhoods pricier than older neighbourhoods based on the plots.
